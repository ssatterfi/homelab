Sure, here are the steps to build a Hercules mainframe emulator container that includes MVS, TSO\ISPF, and CICS:

Start by creating a Dockerfile. This file will contain the instructions for building the container image.
sql
Copy code
FROM debian:latest

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y hercules && \
    apt-get install -y tsoispf && \
    apt-get install -y cics

COPY hercules.conf /etc/hercules.conf

CMD ["/usr/bin/hercules", "-f", "/etc/hercules.conf"]
In the Dockerfile, we start with a base image of Debian, which is a popular Linux distribution. We then install the Hercules mainframe emulator, TSO\ISPF, and CICS.

Next, we copy a preconfigured hercules.conf file into the container. This file specifies the system configuration for Hercules, including the hardware definition and the configuration for MVS, TSO\ISPF, and CICS.

Finally, we set the default command for the container to run Hercules with the hercules.conf file as the configuration.

Now that we have the Dockerfile, we can build the container image. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the Dockerfile is located. Then run the following command:

Copy code
docker build -t hercules-mvs .
This command will build the container image with the tag "hercules-mvs". Note the dot at the end of the command, which specifies that the Dockerfile is located in the current directory.

Once the image is built, we can use docker-compose to start the container. Create a docker-compose.yml file in the same directory as the Dockerfile:
vbnet
Copy code
version: '3'
services:
  hercules:
    image: hercules-mvs
    ports:
      - "3270:3270"
      - "8038:8038"
This file defines a single service called "hercules" that uses the "hercules-mvs" image we built earlier. It also maps port 3270, which is used for terminal connections to MVS, and port 8038, which is used for the CICS Web interface.

To start the container, run the following command:
Copy code
docker-compose up -d
This will start the container in the background.

Once the container is running, you can connect to it using a terminal emulator such as x3270. Connect to localhost:3270 to access MVS, and localhost:8038 to access the CICS Web interface.
That's it! You now have a Hercules mainframe emulator container that includes MVS, TSO\ISPF, and CICS, running in a Docker container.

what id the docker file nameing convention
The Dockerfile naming convention is simply "Dockerfile" (without any file extension). This means that if you want to create a Docker image from a Dockerfile, you should name your file "Dockerfile" and place it in the root directory of your project.

However, if you have multiple Dockerfiles in your project, you can give them different names, as long as you use the "-f" flag with the "docker build" command to specify the name of the Dockerfile you want to use.

For example, if you have a Dockerfile for your main application and another Dockerfile for your database, you can name them "Dockerfile" and "Dockerfile.database", respectively. Then, you can use the following commands to build the two images:

Copy code
docker build -t myapp .
docker build -t mydatabase -f Dockerfile.database .
In the second command, the "-f" flag is used to specify the name of the Dockerfile for the database image.

tar xvzf ../hercules-3.13.tar.gz
cd hercules-3.13

Download the distribution file hercules-3.13.tar.gz
Note: By downloading this file you agree to the terms of the Q Public Licence.
Use these commands to unzip the distribution file:
tar xvzf ../hercules-3.13.tar.gz
cd hercules-3.13
Verify you have all of the correct versions of all of the required packages installed:
./util/bldlvlck

Generate the configure script:
./autogen.sh

Configure Hercules for your system:
./configure

By default, the configure script will attempt to guess appropriate compiler optimization flags for your system. If its guesses turn out to be wrong, you can disable all optimization by passing the --disable-optimization option to configure, or specify your own optimization flags with --enable-optimization=FLAGS

For additional configuration options, run: ./configure --help

Build the executables:
make

Install the programs: as root:
make install

3.04 What software do I need to build Hercules on Linux and Unix?
To build Hercules for Linux and other Unix-like environments you need to use the gcc compiler, version 3.x or above. You will also need a full set of GNU development tools, including recent versions of autoconf, automake, libiconv, make, perl, sed, and m4. Refer to the util/bldlvlck file in the Hercules distribution for details.
